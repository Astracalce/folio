                <span>Poster breakdown : </span>The blueish toned poster designed for Netflix captures the intensity and rawness of this unforgettable story. As blue and green are the closest to nature i had used the blue for this one. The main title scene, which is almost visible gives some dark tone to the poster and the blood dripping from the eye of the protagnist also gives the vibe of some thrill.

            <p>" Bitcoin Chaha ", don't wonder why you have not seen this thing on Netflix. It doesn't exist there. I tried to test my skills by designing this dummy poster on the eve of Eid. In the backend of my mind, I had a character who is called Bitcoin Chacha and who starts getting into the world of bitcoin. During his journey, he went through many things that eventually forced him to quit, losing all of his assets except the fame that he had attained as BC (Bitcoin Chacha).

                <span>Poster breakdown : </span>For the harsh essence, I tried to add some crunchy effects, which eventually made the poster look sharp and also increased the aesthetics of the concept that is behind the poster.
