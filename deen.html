                <h1>A question of deen and dunya : how to follow religion today?</h1>

                <hr>

                    <p>


                    Most of us struggle to make time for our religious obligations in the midst of our wordly lives. Today, the majority of Muslims look for an answer to this pivotal question, how to strike a balance between practicing Deen and living in the Dunya? This is a query not just related to contemporary times. It arose in the early stages of Islam as well.</p>

                    <p>  A Companion of the Prophet, Hanzala (RA) feared that he had become a hypocrite because, during his day-to-day activities pertaining to his family or his business, thoughts of Allah would slip from his mind. He shared this concern with Abu Bakr (RA) who admitted to feeling the same. So they both went to the Prophet (PBUH) and Hanzala (RA) inquired: </p>
                    <p>
                    “Allah’s Messenger, when we are in your company, we are reminded of Hell-Fire and Paradise as if we are seeing them with our own eyes, but whenever we go away from you and attend to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our minds.” </p>
                    
                    <p>Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said: “By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your paths but, Hanzala, time should be devoted (to the worldly affairs) and time (should be devoted to prayer and meditation). He (the Holy Prophet) said this thrice.” (Sahih Muslim 2750)</p>
                    
                    <p> What is clear from this Hadith is that Muslims are expected to balance both the deen and the dunya. We are not expected to become monks, completely cut off from all of the world, nor is it permitted to be engrossed so much in the world as to forget about our faith. </p>
                    
                    <p>Many of us struggle with a misconception that deen and dunya are separate. in reality, they are not separate, rather entwined with each other. Before we get to the core of the topic, it is vital to know the difference between Deen and religion. More than often, both are taken synonymously but just like they don’t sound the same, they are not the same. Deen and Religion differ in multiple aspects.<p> 
                    
                <p>Religion can be defined as ‘belief in spiritual things’. Its scope is limited to dogma, rituals, and a variety of social customs to mark important events. Religion covers the individual relationship a person has with God. </p>
                    
                <p>Islam is not a mere religion, in its technical meaning. It is defined as ‘deen’, which encapsulates the concepts of accepting Allah SWT as sovereign over everything; submitting oneself to His commands; and, to be accountable to Him for our actions. Taken together with their entire meanings, Deen refers to a complete code of life, laying down not only the way we need to worship Allah but also the way we must center our entire lives so that we prioritize Him and His commands i.e. submit to Him in all aspects of life. <p>
                    
                    <p>An important point to understand is that if we follow Deen in its true spirit, everything will fall in its due order. There is no way one is not  able to maintain a balance between Deen and Dunya, following Deen.  Deen enriches our worldly life. It makes it more effective, and efficient. The benefits of adhering to Deen first, is that when we please Allah SWT, we invite ease and blessings in our worldly affairs as well. <p>
                    
                        <p>Allah SWT says in Surah Baqarah: 
                    
                        And among the people is he who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,” and he will have in the Hereafter no share. Yet there are others who say, “Our Lord! Grant us the good of this world and the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.” Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account.” (Surah Baqarah, 2:200-202). <p>
                    
                            <p> Running after the worldly possessions might get you material gains in this short-lived world. But following Deen will get you both, the Deen and Dunya.<p>
                    
                                <p>  It is understandable that in this fast-paced world, one finds it difficult to make time proportionately for everything. But once we understand that the deen guides every aspect of life, we realise that we don’t have to especially find time to practice deen. Deen is there in every facet of our lives. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has provided us with a perfect example of concurrently managing the worldly life with the deen. His life is an example of the deen beautifying every  moment of life: from trade, battles, and governance to family, friendships, and community. His Sunnah is our shining guide to balance deen and dunya. <p>
                    
                                    <p> He said,
                    
                    “I am leaving two heavy things among you, that is, the Quran and Sunnah. Hold on to these two things, you will never go astray”
                    
                    (Muwatta Imam Malik, 2408a)</p>

                <h2>Question:
                    Earlier, you mentioned that you have travelled to various countries around the globe, so I am assuming that you would have been a music lover at one point in time. Therefore, could you please tell youngsters about the turning point in your life after which you stopped listening to music?</h2>

                    <hr>

                    <p>

                        When I began my journey towards Allah (SWT)’s path, music was actually one of the last things I left. Believe me, I was always looking for ways to justify my music addiction. I had three shelves across my bedroom wall full of music CDs. Not only this, but I also had about 10-15 GBs worth of music stored on my computer. But despite looking far and wide, I was unable to find reasons that would justify my love for music. I told myself that since I am trying to be a better person, a better Muslim and striving to live according to Allah (SWT)’s prescribed way; I should leave all things impermissible in Islam. 

                        </p>
                        <p>For this reason, I asked my helper to remove all my CDs from the shelves, put them in a box and throw them in the big trash can outside my house. My helper even suggested that I sell these CDs instead, but I refused and immediately discarded the boxes. However, shortly after, I realised that scavengers and waste collectors could easily remove these boxes full of CDs from the trash and sell them in the market. This way, the CDs I had once bought would be circulated in the community again and could end up on someone else’s shelf. Therefore, I poured a small amount of kerosene oil on top of the CDs to melt them slightly or damage them enough to become waste so they could not be used ever again (do not try this at home). Upon returning home, I put all my downloaded music in one file, thousands and thousands of mp3s, by the way, and I simply pressed shift-delete. I breathed a sigh of relief, said ‘Alhamdulillah’ (praise be to God) and promised Allah (SWT) that I would not return to this, In Sha Allah (if God wills). This was my turning point. </p>

                <h1>Dua : The best therapy!</h1>

                <hr>

                <p> I’ve learnt this lesson the hard way. And I still often forget it. Perhaps reminding you will help me remind myself.  </p>

                <p> There are two ways to deal with a problem. </p>
            
                <p> The first one is the path I originally took (and one I still struggle to leave). You can ignore your trial. Fake it till you make it (or, hah, even if you don’t). And why won’t you ignore it? There are thousands and thousands of distractions available, the best one being a 4.7 inch wide glass screen we all seem to have available in our pockets. </p>
            
                <p> We can drown. Drown, deep, deep into just chatting, binge-watching, basically just looking for the dopamine hit. Or picking up any other activity and getting lost in it. Just feeding our nafs, nurturing it only, and forgetting all about our Ruh. This can cause horrible results – ruining our sleep schedules, messing up our nutritional intakes, and worst of all, breaking our Imaan. </p>
            
                <p> Think for a moment about what godless people turn to. Drugs, alcohol, haram relationships…it actually is the end of the same road. Chasing after any spec of comfort, any distraction they can find. </p>
            
                <p> Imagine if someone has a ticking time bomb in their car’s trunk, and they know there’s a time bomb in their car’s trunk, and the strategy they decide to adopt is…ignore it. Turn on loud music and start headbanging. Start pretending it’s not there, because that would be too stressful.    </p>
            
                <p> Crazy as it may sound, unfortunately, that is the strategy I and many others always adopt when faced with depression and anxiety. But distractions are just an extremely temporary breather. They never actually solve the problem. Not even a tiny bit. So whether the music stops or not, that bomb’s gonna blow the car to smithereens anyway. In the same way, at the end of the day, when the noise dies down and the lights fade away, you’re left with that same old problem on your shoulders, crushing you.  </p>
            
                <p> And when that darkness becomes too heavy to bear, and the distractions stop working, we curl up in a corner and cry ourselves to sleep. Or message long rants to some close friend, trying to lighten our hearts. Yet all that heavy weight never budges, still clouding our minds, breaking our hearts. </p>
            
                <p> If only we knew how to put it down.  </p>
            
                <p> Imagine Allah Ta’ala watching us. Imagine Him Saying, “Why, O slave? Why are you running to the creation? Why are you seeking comfort in these hollow worldly distractions? Why do you sit and cry all alone? Why do you nurse your bruised and broken heart all alone? Come to Me. Cry to Me. Come and put your burden down in front of Me, O servant! Can you not see I am Waiting? Can you not see I am always Listening?” </p>
            
                <p> When you make dua, you take those boulders off your shoulders, one by one. You cry out all your troubles to the One who never gets tired, to the One who will never turn you back, who will never get sick of hearing your troubles. And once you finally put them down, you realize: oh. THAT’S how I was supposed to get rid of these. That’s how I was supposed to put them down. </p>
            
                <p> Make dua. Try it.  </p>
            
                <p> It actually works.  </p>

                <h1>Getting Started with Arabic: A Roadmap !</h1>

                <hr>

    <p>A brother asked me:(itne saal Arabic language padhne k baad ap ka kya khayal hai How should we start studying the Arabic language, presumably from scratch?) </p>

    <p>Even though I have written many times about it, I will mention some points regarding learning this beautiful language based on what I have learned from the books of scholars.First of all, a person must be able to read the Quran. He should learn the basics of tajweed and know how to recite the Quran. 

    <p>Then he should study a basic textbook on Arabic with a teacher. The book should focus more on text and vocabulary than grammar. Like the famous book of <b>
        V. Abdur Rahim (Madinah Books, Durusul Lugah Arabiyyah)</b>,During the study of this book, a student should not read any other book in Arabic at all! He should put all his effort into understanding the sentence structure, basic grammar, and vocabulary in this book.If you can't find any teachers, there are lectures available on YouTube. In English, Urdu, and Kashmiri on the same book. I have myself studied from the lectures of <b>Asif Mehrali (Lqtoronto.com) </b>(Lqtorontosupport on YouTube).</p>


    <p>The author has himself written notes on this book (Key Facts) that are available with the book (Madinah Books for English-Speaking Students).After studying this book, one should revise it and then read the text as much as possible while keeping a dictionary handy. 
        
        <br><br>
        Some dictionaries: 1) Hans Wehr, Arabic to English. 2) Al-Qamoos ul Waheed Arabic-Urdu. 3) AlMujam ul Waseet Arabic-Arabic </p>

    <p>The most part during the beginning years of learning Arabic is to reflect on the Usloob/Style/ Structure of the Kalaam Sentence. Arabic needs to be learned, as was narrated by Arabs, not by Englishizing or Urduing it! There is no problem with relating some things to what you know from other languages in the beginning, but we must not forget that Arabic is different from other languages. It has its own style and way of using the words in the sentence. Vocabulary can be developed through text or book reading. While reading the book, one must use the dictionary so as to put the meanings in their proper context.</p>

    <p>Some authors whose books are beneficial:
        <br>
        Abul Hasan Nadwi, 
        <br>
        Ali Tantawi, 
        <br>
        Mustafa Lutfi Manfalutī,
        <br>
        Mustafa Amin, 
        <br>
        Ali Jaarim, 
        <br>
        Sulaiman Uyunialel. </p>
